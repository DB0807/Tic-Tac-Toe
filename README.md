# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is my Tic-Tac-Toe project that I created while doing The Odin Project.
I have attempted to incorporate recently learned factory functions, more modular code and IIFEs.
This project has not had any real attempt to be styled in any way, this was done more to practice the aforementioned skills
